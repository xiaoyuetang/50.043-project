0,B000F83SZQ,5,I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.,"05 5, 2014",A1F6404F1VG29J,Avidreader,Nice vintage story,1399248000
1,B000F83SZQ,4,"This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of, say, Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting, explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times, like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still, it was well worth a look-see.","01 6, 2014",AN0N05A9LIJEQ,critters,Different...,1388966400
2,B000F83SZQ,4,"This was a fairly interesting read.  It had old- style terminology.I was glad to get  to read a story that doesn't have coarse, crasslanguage.  I read for fun and relaxation......I like the free ebooksbecause I can check out a writer and decide if they are intriguing,innovative, and have enough of the command of Englishthat they can convey the story without crude language.","04 4, 2014",A795DMNCJILA6,dot,Oldie,1396569600

5,B000F83SZQ,4,A beautiful in-depth character description makes it like a fast pacing movie. It is a pity Mr Merwin did not write 30 instead only 3 of the Amy Brewster mysteries.,"05 26, 2014",A1RK2OCZDSGC6R,ubavka seirovska,Review,1401062400
6,B000F83SZQ,4,"I enjoyed this one tho I'm not sure why it's called An Amy Brewster Mystery as she's not in it very much. It was clean, well written and the characters well drawn.","06 10, 2014",A2HSAKHC3IBRE6,Wolfmist,Nice old fashioned story,1402358400
7,B000F83SZQ,4,"Never heard of Amy Brewster. But I don't need to like Amy Brewster to like this book. Actually, Amy Brewster is a side kick in this story, who added mystery to the story not the one resolved it. The story brings back the old times, simple life, simple people and straight relationships.","03 22, 2014",A3DE6XGZ2EPADS,WPY,Enjoyable reading and reminding the old times,1395446400
8,B000FA64PA,5,Darth Maul working under cloak of darkness committing sabotage now that is a story worth reading many times over.  Great story.,"10 11, 2013",A1UG4Q4D3OAH3A,dsa,Darth Maul,1381449600
9,B000FA64PA,4,"This is a short story focused on Darth Maul's role in helping the Trade Federation gain a mining colony. It's not bad, but it's also nothing exceptional. It's fairly short so we don't really get to see any characters develop. The few events that do happen seem to go by quickly, including what should have been major battles. The story is included in the novelShadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul), which is worth reading, so don't bother to buy this one separately.","02 13, 2011",AQZH7YTWQPOBE,Enjolras,"Not bad, not exceptional",1297555200
10,B000FA64PA,5,I think I have this one in both book and audio. It is a good story either way. good ol' Maul.,"01 27, 2014",A1ZT7WV0ZUA0OJ,Mike,Audio and book,1390780800
11,B000FA64PA,4,Title has nothing to do with the story.  I did enjoy it though.  Good short story about Darth Maul setting up two corporations against each other.  All in the end to help Darth Sidious' rise to power.  Won't take you long to read & it's cheap.  Go for it.,"09 17, 2011",A2ZFR72PT054YS,monkeyluis,Darth Maul...the brother I never had.,1316217600
12,B000FA64PA,3,Well written. Interesting to see Sideous (through Maul) maneuvering events to fit his plan. We see human nature at work. But no good guys to root for. Even Rurit is a helpless pawn.,"12 31, 2013",A2QK1U70OJ74P,Sharon Deem,Not bad; it is well written,1388448000
13,B000FA64PK,3,"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600
14,B000FA64PK,5,"I am not for sure on how much of a difference the short story has on the overall series (I haven't read on yet), but I would recommend that anyone buy it to help them understand the whole series better.P.S.- The series is one of the best of all the Star Wars series.","05 12, 2013",A3H8PE1UFK04JZ,Caleb Watts,Possibly Important,1368316800

17,B000FA64PK,3,"Another well written eBook by Troy Denning, but why is it put where it is? Why not a part of Balance Point? It is well written and belongs in the new Jedi Order. I just don't think it should stand alone. It is fun and fast to read on my Kindle, but not even in paperback????","04 16, 2009",A38Z3Q6DTDIH9J,"Jimmy J.

19,B000FA64PK,4,"I have a version of ""Star by Star"" that does not include the novella ""Recovery,"" so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  ""Recovery"" tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in ""Balance Point.""  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship, it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out, like in the DVD's, where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it, but probably not to everyone.","07 20, 2012",A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,Noname,"Not a necessary read, but I liked it",1342742400
